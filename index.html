        <h1>Welcome to Jamie Howell's Personal Website!</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jamie Howell. I am currently a Sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Engineering Physics.
            I have specific interests in focusing on Computational Physics, as I find solving and modeling physics related problems with programming deeply interesting.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently, my strongest programming languages are Python and Java; however this list is being continuously expanded. I also have some beginner HTML and CSS knowledge,
            which was used to create the website you're reading now!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        
        <p>
            As for personal interests, my hobbies include but are not limited to: gaming, exploring the great outdoors, lifting, and spending far too much time on YouTube!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My go-to games are typically League of Legends, CS:GO, and Oldschool Runescape. So if you play any of those, you're automatically cool in my book!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also I huge music enthusiast, with tastes coving a wide variety of genres, ranging anywhere from rap to electronic to indie.
            A link to my Spotify is provided below to check out my playlists.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Features Coming Soon</h2>
        
        <p>
            This site is currently a work in progress. Features I plan to add soon include a Navbar linking to a gallery and projects as well as some colorful CSS.
            However, for the time I have left for this EC assignment, what I have currently will have to do! (I'm most proud of the cool links below =D).
        </p>
